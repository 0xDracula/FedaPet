# Hackapet 🐾

**Hackapet** is a small interactive game where you take care of a virtual pet. You can feed it and play with it to change its mood. It comes with a pet that reacts to the actions you perform!
## This project was made with a challenge from the hackclub, which is to fit a program/game into a qr code!
